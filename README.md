### 🖼 Description

**Cool-Mint-Breeze-Icons** is a modern, unified icon set designed to complement the [Cool-Mint-Breeze GTK theme](https://www.pling.com/p/2302153/).
It is a unique and cohesive theme tailored specifically for Linux Mint users who want a fresh visual experience while preserving a familiar aesthetic base.

The set includes redesigned system icons, updated application icons, and custom folder styles to enhance clarity and harmony across the system.

It is partially based on open source icon themes licensed under the GPL, such as:

* **Breeze** – many icons were used as-is or modified
* **Numix-Circle** – used occasionally for some application icons
* **Papirus** – used in very small parts (e.g., one or two icons)
* **Hicolor** – one or two icons included from this fallback theme

In addition, inspired by the **Breeze** theme, I have created a **brand new set of mimetype icons**. Many of these icons, including several file types and special cases, were **designed entirely by me**.
While it draws inspiration from Mint-Relaxed, I have **restructured the folder design**, replacing the original folders with a new set of custom-designed folder icons.

## Features

* Brand new mimetype icon set inspired by Breeze
* Redesigned folder icons
* Many custom icons built from the ground up
